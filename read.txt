Crawling in my skin these wounds they will not heal. I've becoome so numb, I can't see you there. I've become so tired, so much more of this . By becoming this all I want you to is be more like me and be less like you. I have aids. Against my will I stand beside my own reflection. It's haunting and I can't believe it. I am unbroken. I'm choking on this ecstacy. Unbreak me. Unchain me. I need another chance to leave. The sand is singing deathless words to me.
